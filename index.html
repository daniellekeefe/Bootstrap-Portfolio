                      <p>Hello, my name is Danielle Keefe. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p> I am extremely excited to be taking this class and gaining development skills. 
                      I am extremely driven an all facets of my life, professional, personal and recreational. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p> Professionally, I have had the privilege of working in the digital media space for the last 14 years and rising the ranks to an executive team. 
                      In digital media I started at the bottom as a trafficking associate, learning all things operations. Through my time in trafficking I built a strong operational technical base, allowing me focus on ad serving integrations on an enterprise level, overseeing major Ad Serving integration projects for 20+ clients, notably Viacom (MTV, BET and Logo networks), Dwell and Yankee Magazine networks. 
                      While I evolved in my professional roles, so did the industry with the introduction of the smart phone, allowing me to shift and build a Mobile Advertising Network product. In overseeing the build of a mobile network,  I managed the project by overseeing technology needs, marketing, operational/financial best practices and business development needs. 
                      Strong partnership relations allowed me to join the executive team at my current company, entering as head of publisher operations, and growing into a role of VP of Operations (ad operations, publisher operations, publisher development and sell-side). </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Recreationally, I have had the privilege of playing Ice Hockey for the past 33 years and still going strong. I am most proud of my time playing at Northeastern University class of 2003 and recently 3x USA 30+ National Championship Assabet Valley team. </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>I am eager to learn more and continue in my professional development.
